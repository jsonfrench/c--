I am going to try learning c++ and git at the same time.
I will document my journey as I go.

Last night was a major breakthrough. I managed to get all the software working that had been stumping me for months.
C++ and github are finally behaving nicely, and I've figured out the basics for each of them.
I can now begin learning c++ and keeping track of my progress. 
I'm making my way through a book called "Learn C++ By Making Games" which I commandeered from a random bookshelf in one of the academic building's hallways. 
Topics Learned: 
- cout 
- cin 
- cerr 
- injection (<<) and extraction (>>) operators
