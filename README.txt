I am going to try learning c++ and git at the same time.
I will document my journey as I go.

Last night was a major breakthrough. I managed to get all the software working that had been stumping me for months.
C++ and github are finally behaving nicely, and I've figured out the basics for each of them.
I can now begin learning c++ and keeping track of my progress. 
I'm making my way through a book called "Learn C++ By Making Games" which I commandeered from a random bookshelf in one of the academic building's hallways. 
Topics Learned: 
- cout 
- cin 
- cerr 
- injection (<<) and extraction (>>) operators

I lost my commit streak because I didn't push anything until after midnight. Huge L.
I'm starting to realize that c++ is a LOT like java. Most of the basic syntax is the same - loops, assignments, operators, conditionals...
The biggest differences are the std::cout << and bitwise operators. I prefer c++. 
Anyway I ditched the book for now since I wanted to speed through the rest of the basics. Now I'm using W3Schools. Great website. 
I've heard from a classmate that classes are way different, something about needing header files and stuff. So we'll see if its any better than java in that regard. 
Next on the agenda is learning about structs and pointers. I know how notorious pointers are in c. I have no fear. 
Topics learned: 
- operators
    - math
    - comparison
    - bitwise
- flow control
    - if else if else
    - switch
    - for
    - for each
    - while
    - do while
- arrays
    - traversing arrays
    - multidemnsional arrays
Maybe when I learn how to use classes I can cook up some data structures. I'm sure there's already libraries with much better implementations than I could make, but it would be a good exercise.
